# Triangle-Counting-Research

I assisted on this project which was led by Dr. David Bader at his lab within NJITâ€™s Department of Data Science. I worked with other students to implement a sequential version of the parallel BFS-based algorithm in a simulation to find the number of triangles in social networks. The simulation was used to determine the optimal intersection method that requires the least amount of communication between nodes in the graph.
